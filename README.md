In this exercise we will use a github repo to collaboratively collate and simulate evolutionary trajectories for each participants' species body size using a simple brownian motion evolutionary model. This assumes evolutionary steps to progress comletely at random. You could say, it's a bit of lottery!


## **our mission**

- Each participant will **create and contribute a file** specifying the parameters required to simulate and plot their species evolutionary trajectory.
- We'll collect all participants' files in the master repo.
- Once all trajectories are simulated they'll be plotted together.
- Participants will then get to **see the skull and beak shape** corresponding to their species relative body size!

<br>

### **Next Session: Join Remotely!**
## [**NHM STARS training course**](https://mozillafestival.org/): **Thursday, 18th May 11:00-12:00**

We'll be **accepting pull requests** by remote participants between **11.30 - 12.00**, so anyone can get involved! Follow [**#EvoLottery**](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=EvoLottery&src=typd) on the day for live updates on twitter.

# **GO!**
[link to full session handout](https://annakrystalli.github.io/Mozfest_github-rstudio/index.html)

#### **github:** fork

- fork the repo into your own account
- copy repo url link local files to github repo

<br>

#### **rstudio:** clone locally

- create new project
- checkout from version control/git
- paste github repo link

<br>

#### **rstudio:** create parameter `.R` script

A template is provided in the repo, in folder `/params` named `params_tmpl.R`. Open the `params_tmpl.R` and **save as** to create a duplicate template. Name the template using the name of your species.

##### **!! PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THE `params_tmpl.R` FILE !!**

<br>

#### **rstudio:** edit your params `.R` script

The parameters each participants need to supply are:

- **`3`** A numeric value greater than 0 but smaller than 5

- **`John Brookius`:** a character string e.g. `"anas_krystallinus"`. Try to create a species name out of your name!

- **`green`:** e.g. `"red"`, `"#FFFFFF"` (tip: **pick a color using Rstudio's Color picker:**)

<br>

#### **rstudio:** save and commit the changes

- Use the git tab, tick the box next to **your new script ONLY** and commit.

- Supply a descriptive message of the commit.

<br>

#### **rstudio:** push to github
- push your changes to github

<br>

#### **github:** create pull request
 - create a pull request to merge your changes to the master repo

#### **github:** check to see my response to your request
 - most likely it'll be a thumbs up! But I might also **request a correction** if I spot an error.

<br>



### Once all parameters are collated, look out for the [results](http://rpubs.com/annakrystalli/278074)!

## Running Evolottery locally

### Setup

You will need [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your local system.

First, open Rstudio and install a couple of setup packages you will need.

```r
install.packages(c("renv", "usethis"))

```

### Clone fork

Next, **clone your own fork of the repository**. In the code example below you will need to edit the `repo_spec` argument with your own GitHub account name as well as supply the path where you want the repo cloned to in `destdir`.

```r
usethis::create_from_github(repo_spec = "YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME/collaborative_github_exercise",
                            fork = FALSE, destdir = "path/where/you/want/the/repo/cloned/to")
```

This will clone your fork from GitHub and open up the project.

### Install dependencies by restoring `renv` library

The project uses `renv` for dependency management. To install all required dependencies into the local project library run:

```r
renv::restore()
```

### Synch from upstream repo

Next, **add the `RSE-Sheffield/collaborative_github_exercise` remote repo** to list of remotes **as `upstream`**

```r
usethis::use_git_remote(name = "upstream", url ="https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/collaborative_github_exercise.git" , overwrite = TRUE)
```

Next, **pull** from the upstream repository:
```r
usethis::pr_merge_main()
```

You should now have all the parameter files submitted by participants in your local `params/` folder

### Run Evolottery

Finally, to generate the Evolottery html webpage, you will need to knit the `plot_trait_evolution.Rmd` file.

Open the `plot_trait_evolution.Rmd` file and on the top panel click on the **knit** button. This runs the code and renders the content of the file to html.

Note that because trait evolution is random, your version of the results will differ from those published in the upstream repo.
